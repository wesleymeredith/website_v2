{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"housing-price-prediction","title":"Housing Price Prediction Challenge","description":"Secured a top 12% ranking on Kaggle's housing price prediction challenge by applying machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning techniques.","longDescription":"This project involved comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Ames Housing dataset to gain insights into key patterns and trends. I implemented and optimized multiple machine learning algorithms including decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn grid search, I enhanced prediction accuracy by 15%. The project secured a top 12% ranking among 24,000 participants on Kaggle, demonstrating strong machine learning fundamentals and competitive data science skills.","techStack":["Python","Neural Networks","XGBoost","Machine Learning"],"images":["/images/projects/StockNewsCover.png"],"github":"https://github.com/wesleymeredith/Ames-Housing-Project","date":"2023"}},"__N_SSG":true}
